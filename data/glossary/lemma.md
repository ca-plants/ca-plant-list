A bract at the base of a [grass flower](./floret.html) (floret). The lemma is often visually similar to the [glumes](./glume.html), and often has striped veins running along its length.

The lemma may contain an [awn](./awn.html) (a bristle-like structure projecting beyond the lemma).

The lemma is fertile if there is a flower above it (attached to the [rachilla](./rachilla.html) at the same point as the lemma), otherwise it is sterile.
